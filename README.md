Unity MS Paint
===

If you want your players to be able to draw inside your game but don't know how to do it, here is a good place to start. I couldn't find any satisfying examples online, so I'm sharing my own.

Features
---

* Monochromatic drawings;
* Variable brush size;
* Screen wipe.

I know it isn't anything sophisticated, but it was enough for my own game, so I have reason to believe it could help somebody.

**Please feel free to contribute new features and fixes!!**
